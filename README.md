# mini_shell

The goal of this project is to implement a mini shell that mimics the BASH shell by using Linux Kernel System calls and IPC mechanisms like signals. It will also handle special keyboard actions (ex: Ctrl + C to terminate process, Ctrl + Z to stop process), utilize pipes, and execute internal commands such as ‘cd’.
